# HW1

## Descriptions:

*Reads each line, kill whitepsace and anything after comment characters (#), break each line on comma, read rows into a list of lists (one   list per row), converting strings to numbers where appropriate. Note that some column headers contain ?: all such columns should be ignored. For now you can ignore the other magic characters in row1.
* Checks for bad lines (and bad lines will be skipped over); i.e. symbols where numbers should be and wrong number of cells (we will say that row1 has the “right” length).
