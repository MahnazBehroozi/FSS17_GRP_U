# HW1

## Descriptions:

Read each line, kill whitepsace and anything after comment characters (#), break each line on comma, read rows into a list of lists (one list per row), converting strings to numbers where appropriate. Note that some column headers contain ?: all such columns should be ignored. For now you can ignore the other magic characters in row1.
