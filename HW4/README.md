# Description:

To build a regression tree learner:

* Apply supervised Discretization
* At each level of the tree, break the data on the ranges and find the column whose breaks most reduces the variability of the target variable (we will use dom).
* For each break, apply the regression tree learner recursively.
* Recursion stops when the breaks do not improve the supervised target score, when there are tooFew examples to break, or when the tree depth is too much.
